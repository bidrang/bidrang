Building a robust administration panel involves more than just selecting the right stack. It's equally important to design a solid project structure that ensures scalability, maintainability, and a seamless development experience. In this article, I'll take you on a tour of the structure I adopted for my Administrtion Panel React application, showcasing how it embraces Domain Driven Design, CQRS principles, and leverages technologies like [ReactQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/), TypeScript, [Axios](https://axios-http.com/), and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/).

## Embracing Domain Driven Design

To ensure clarity and maintainability, I organized my project using the Domain Driven Design (DDD) approach. The cornerstone of this structure is the "features" folder, where each feature of the application resides. This separation allows for a clear distinction of responsibilities and keeps related code together.

### Feature-Centric Organization

Within the "features" folder, each feature has its own sub-folder, housing screens, components, types, and APIs. This approach promotes a highly modular architecture, making it easier to add, modify, or remove features without causing unintended side effects.

## CQRS for Effective API Management

In the "APIs" folder, I adopted the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern. Each feature has its file containing different queries and mutations, promoting separation of concerns and maintainable API management.

## Leveraging ReactQuery for Data Handling

[ReactQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/) plays a pivotal role in this architecture. I created a custom React hook for each action, making data management seamless and efficient. ReactQuery's built-in caching and data synchronization capabilities ensure that data flows smoothly between the client and server.

## TypeScript and Axios for Robustness

The entire project is developed using TypeScript, adding a layer of type safety that prevents common runtime errors. For API calls, I rely on [Axios](https://axios-http.com/), a versatile and widely adopted HTTP client, ensuring robust and reliable communication with the server.

## Navigating with React Router

For seamless navigation within the application, [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) comes into play. The "routes" folder in the project root contains different route configurations for both protected and public routes, each with its layout. This ensures a clean and organized routing structure.

## Embracing Flexibility and Readability

This architectural approach has created a flexible and highly readable codebase. It allows for effortless feature additions, smooth collaboration among team members, and a pleasant development experience.

In upcoming articles, we'll dive deeper into project details, exploring forms, lists, detail pages, and the tools that empower us to ensure safe and easy future development.
